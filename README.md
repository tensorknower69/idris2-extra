# idris2-extra
My personal library for idris2

This is library exists since usually I can't find what I need from the base/contrib/network/prelude library as the `:search` REPL command is still under development. I may be reinventing the wheel unknowingly.

I'm planning to add JSON parser, HTML parser, minimal af HTTP client, **insecure** cryptography (stealing code from `cryptonite` (a haskell crypto project) and not writing ten billion tests), TLS, and whatever can be found on the python/haskell package index. I may choose Idris2 as my primary language for side projects. Currently, I don't mind if stuff is unsafe or wacky, I just want to be able to write an application first. In the future, I will take this more seriously.

Once TLS and HTTP are implemented, I will be porting `tensorknower69/nhentai` and other stuff to Idris2 asap since they are *useful*.

PRs are welcomed!!!!!111111 If any..., I mean Idris2 is still not well-known yet. How do I make friends in/at/on school
